              <h2>What is eXtrabuck brand?</h2>
              <div class="section">
               <p>eXtrabuck brand started operating in September 2020 with the main aim of 
                  letting people all around the world know alternative ways of saving money.
                  We were mainly inspired to do this by the Covid-19 pandemic that overtook our 
                  whole planet which may as well cause some very serious economic crisis. 
                  Our services are 100% free of any charge and currently work in more then
                  50 countries worldwide.Each year we have more and more countries joining our system and 
                  expanding network.</p>
              </div>  
              <br>
              <h2>What is it all about?</h2>
              <div class="section">
               <p>It's about shopping, 2nd most frequent occurrence in the world after 
                  breathing. Our brand shows you a free iOS/android application which 
                  lets you save money whenever you shop for products or services you need.
                  You would pay for these anyway, wouldn't you? This way you can save up 
                  to 15% money back, each time you shop. It works for both local and online 
                  shopping, giving you your benefits every time.</p>
              </div> 
              <br>
              <h2>We raise money for our Ecology and Charity Foundations!</h2>
              <div class="section">
               <p>Each time you shop, the store pays 1% of total money spent to our  
                  Foundations. It is then equally divided into our Ecology and Charity 
                  Foundation. Same process repeats whenever someone of our 14.5 million 
                  members use our free app and save money. You can find more details and
