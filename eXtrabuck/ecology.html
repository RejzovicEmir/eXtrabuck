                <p>The natural habitats are decreasing dramatically. Our foundation would 
                   like to give nature back what has been taken and has therefore 
                   implemented waste collection campaigns and refosteration projects 
                   together with numerous voluntary helpers across the world. We would also 
                   like to raise awareness on the importance of waste recycling systems 
                   implementation and beginning of using renewable energies as major energy 
                   sources.</p>

                <p>We have done more then 70 projects in 20 countries so far.
                   Over 13,000 beneficiaries worldwide.
                   Reduction of carbon footprint of around 800 km squared
                   1,000 trees to combat poverty. We reforested a forest in Nicaragua.
                   We created recycling campaigns in: Kelowna-Canada,Toronto-Canada, 
                   California-USA, Florida-USA, Santana de Parnaiba-Brazil, 
                   Blumenau-Brazil, Graz-Austria, Prague-Czech Republic, 
                   Skopje-North Macedonia, The beach of Padre Burgos- Philippines 
                   and are currently working to expand our work in more and more 
                   countries worldwide.</p>

                <p>75% of our planet's surface is covered with water, but only 0.5% is 
                   considered as clean drinking water. Humans can survive up to four 
                   weeks without nutrition, but only three to four days without water.
                   A 10-15 minute shower requires about 40 to 80 litres of water. 
                   A bath can take up to 180 litres. Flushing the water moves eight to
                   fifteen litres of water into sewage. You can build a well and give 
                   fresh drinkable water for people in need with the cost of only 500 
                   euros.</p>
